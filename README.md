HyperEditX
==========

Building on what @Khyperia started, and many have added to - @Ezriilc, @blowfishpro, @TriggerAu, @linuxgurugamer.

If you're looking for the original HyperEdit, see <http://www.kerbaltek.com/hyperedit>.
Also see the forum thread at <http://forum.KerbalSpaceProgram.com/threads/37756>.

This is a continuation with some breaking UI changes (quite literally in some cases!). It's also a better place for me to try out some things away from the main codebase.

Please limit any conversations about this mod to GitHub as it's not really related to the original just yet!
Likewise, any new test releases will be limited to here.
